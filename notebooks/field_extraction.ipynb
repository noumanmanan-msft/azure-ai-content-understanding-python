    "\n",
    "**Key Schema Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`baseAnalyzerId`**: Crucial setting that specifies the prebuilt analyzer to derive from (e.g., `prebuilt-documentAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-audioAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-videoAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-imageAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-callCenter`). This provides foundational capabilities for your custom analyzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`fields`**: Defines specific data points to extract. Each field includes:\n",
    "  - **Field name**: Identifier for the extracted data (required and important for referencing results)\n",
    "  - **Description**: Optional but helpful for documentation and understanding the field's purpose\n",
    "  - **Method**: Can be `\"extract\"` (for extracting existing information from documents - currently only available for document analysis) or `\"generate\"` (for generating new insights using AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`method`**: The overall extraction approach - use `\"extract\"` for standard field extraction from documents or `\"generate\"` when AI should generate insights or summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: The `\"extract\"` method is currently only available for document analysis (using `prebuilt-documentAnalyzer`). For other modalities like audio, video, and images, use the `\"generate\"` method.\n",

    "Content Understanding offers three segmentation options to slice a video, enabling you to get output for entire videos or short clips. You can specify these by setting the `segmentationMode` property in your custom analyzer:\n",
    "- Whole-video – `\"segmentationMode\": \"noSegmentation\"`  \n",
    "  The service treats the entire video file as a single segment and extracts metadata across its full duration.  \n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "    - Compliance checks looking for specific brand-safety issues anywhere in an ad\n",
    "    - Full-length descriptive summaries\n",
    "- Automatic segmentation – `\"segmentationMode\": \"auto\"`  \n",
    "  The service analyzes the timeline, automatically segmenting the video. It groups successive shots into coherent scenes, capped at one minute each.  \n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "    - Creating storyboards from a show\n",
    "    - Inserting mid-roll ads at logical pauses\n",
    "- Custom segmentation – `\"segmentationMode\": \"custom\"`  \n",
    "  You describe the segmentation logic in natural language, and the model creates segments accordingly. Set `segmentationDefinition` with a string describing your desired segmentation. Custom segmentation allows segments of varying length from seconds to minutes.  \n",
